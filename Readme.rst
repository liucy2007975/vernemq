VerneMQ is a high-performance, distributed MQTT message broker. It scales horizontally and vertically on commodity hardware to support a high number of concurrent publishers and consumers while maintaining low latency and fault tolerance. VerneMQ is the reliable message hub for your IoT platform or smart products.

VerneMQ is an Apache2 licensed distributed `MQTT <http://www.mqtt.org>`_ broker, developed in `Erlang <http://www.erlang.org>`_.

MQTT used to stand for MQ Telemetry Transport, but it no longer is an acronym. It is an extremely simple and lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol, that was invented at IBM and Arcom (now Eurotech) to connect restricted devices in low bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.

VerneMQ implements the MQTT 3.1 and 3.1.1 specifications, integration of MQTT-SN is planned. Currently the following features are implemented:

* QoS 0, QoS 1, QoS 2
* Basic Authentication and Authorization
* Bridge Support
* $SYS Tree for monitoring and reporting
* TLS (SSL) Encryption
* Websockets Support
* Cluster Support
* SNMP Monitoring
* Logging (Console, Files, Syslog)
* Reporting to Graphite
* Extensible Plugin architecture
* Multiple Sessions per ClientId
* Session Balancing
* Message load regulation
* Message load shedding (for system protection)
* Offline Message Storage (based on LevelDB)
* Queue can handle messages FIFO or LIFO style.
* MongoDB integration (via. `vmq_diversity <https://github.com/erlio/vmq_diversity>`_)
* Redis integration (via. `vmq_diversity <https://github.com/erlio/vmq_diversity>`_)
* MySQL integration (via. `vmq_diversity <https://github.com/erlio/vmq_diversity>`_)
* PostgreSQL integration (via. `vmq_diversity <https://github.com/erlio/vmq_diversity>`_)
* Webhooks (via. `vmq_diversity <https://github.com/erlio/vmq_diversity>`_)

Commercial Support. Binary Packages. Documentation
--------------------------------------------------

Below you'll find a basic introduction to building and starting VerneMQ. For more
information about the binary package installation, configuration, and administration 
of VerneMQ, please visit our documentation at `VerneMQ Documentation <https://vernemq.com/docs>`_ 
or checkout the product page `VerneMQ <https://vernemq.com>`_ if you require more
information on the available commercial `support options <https://vernemq.com/services.html>`_.

Quick Start
-----------

This section assumes that you have a copy of the VerneMQ source tree. To get
started, you need to first build VerneMQ.

Building VerneMQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: VerneMQ requires Erlang 17.x or 18.x to be installed on your system. 

Assuming you have a working Erlang installation, building VerneMQ should be as
simple as:

.. code-block:: ini

    $ cd $VERNEMQ
    $ make rel

Starting VerneMQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you've successfully built VerneMQ, you can start the server with the following
commands:

.. code-block:: ini

    $ cd $VERNEMQ/_build/default/rel/vernemq
    $ bin/vernemq start

Note that the ``$VERNEMQ/_build/default/rel/vernemq`` directory is a complete, 
self-contained instance of VerneMQ and Erlang. It is strongly suggested that you
move this directory outside the source tree if you plan to run a production 
instance.
